Do not uwu, $350 fine

## Installation

Edit `config.json` to fill in your token, and preferences for what channels the police should or shouldn't patrol. Then you can spin up the bot in a docker container by running `startbot` or `startbot.bat` depending on your platform

```bash
~/degenpolice$ ./startbot
```

## Usage

Instructions of how to create and get a bot token, and how to invite a bot to your server can be found [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html).
